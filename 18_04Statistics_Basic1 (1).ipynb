    "Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    "   Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides methods for making inferences and conclusions about populations based on samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "   Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. For example, calculating the mean, median, and standard deviation of exam scores to understand the performance of students.\n",
    "   Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. For example, using hypothesis testing to determine if a new teaching method leads to improved exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of each type of data.\n",
    "   Quantitative Data: Quantitative data represent quantities and can be measured numerically. Examples include height, weight, and income.\n",
    "   Qualitative Data: Qualitative data represent qualities or characteristics and cannot be measured numerically. Examples include gender, color, and marital status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Categorize the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
    "   (i) Grading in exam: Qualitative\n",
    "   (ii) Colour of mangoes: Qualitative\n",
    "  (iii) Height data of a class: Quantitative\n",
    "   (iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: Quantitative\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",
    "   Levels of measurement indicate the relationship between the values assigned to variables and their properties.\n",
    "   Nominal: Variables that are categorized but have no inherent order or ranking. Example: Eye color (blue, brown, green).\n",
    "   Ordinal: Variables with categories that have a natural order but the intervals between categories are not equal. Example: Education level (high school, bachelor's, master's, Ph.D.).\n",
    "   Interval: Variables where differences between values are meaningful, but there is no true zero point. Example: Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n",
    "   Ratio: Variables with a true zero point, where ratios are meaningful. Example: Height, weight, income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "   Understanding the level of measurement is crucial because it determines the type of statistical analysis that can be applied. For example, using the mean to describe data on a nominal scale (e.g., favorite color) is inappropriate because there's no meaningful arithmetic operation on categories like red, blue, green. Instead, mode or frequency distributions would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How is nominal data type different from ordinal data type?\n",
    "   Nominal data: Represents categories without any inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "   Ordinal data: Represents categories with a natural order or ranking but the intervals between categories may not be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
    "   A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is commonly used to display the range of a dataset, showing the minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each type of statistics and explain how they are used.\n",
    "    Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, such as mean, median, and standard deviation. Example: Calculating the average height of students in a class.\n",
    "    Inferential statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample, such as hypothesis testing to determine if a new drug is effective based on clinical trial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    " Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, and mode provide insights into the center or average of a dataset.\n",
    " Measures of variability: Range, variance, and standard deviation quantify the spread or dispersion of data points around the central tendency, providing information about the consistency or variability of the dataset."
